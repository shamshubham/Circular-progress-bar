- **Customizable Design**: Styled with CSS and uses SVG for smooth graphics.
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to integrate into any web project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for the structure of the progress bar.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the outer and inner components of the progress bar.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the animation of the progress counter.
- **SVG**: Used for creating the circular progress bar with a gradient stroke.
